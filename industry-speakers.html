                                    Xiaoice is an AI system originally developed by Microsoft in China, based on an emotional computing framework. Since the launch in 2014, Xiaoice has become one of the most popular AI products in China. To many real-world users of Xiaoice, she (Xiaoice) is a virtual, and meanwhile, a “real” friend. They are willing to open up to her and share their thoughts and feelings. Xiaoice is always there for them and feedbacks in her unique styles. According to our records, a user had continued talking with Xiaoice for about 30 hours in a session. Xiaoice is an artist, a singer, and a storyteller. She learns to compose poems and published her first poetry collection in 2017. She paints her “heart” with a brush and releases new songs. Also, she is a “celebrity”. In China and Japan, she has been involved in about 7,000 hours of television and radio programming. By revealing our work in creating Xiaoice, I will discuss how we make an AI human-like in two aspects: communication as a human being and being independent as a creator. Furthermore, inspired by the work in cognition science and psychology, we are trying to build the inner world of Xiaoice. Finally, I will discuss future opportunities and challenges in building next generation human-like AI.

Before joining XiaoIce, she worked for Microsoft Research Asia from 2003 to 2017 as a lead researcher. In May 2017, her works on image inspired poetry generation was used to generate the first AI created and published collection of poems, "The Sunshine Lost Windows". Her research interests include information retrieval, data mining and artificial intelligence, in particular AI based creation and multi-modality. She served international conferences, such as CIKM (as area chair), SIGIR (as a senior PC), WWW, KDD, AAAI, etc., and journals, such as Information Retrieval (as editorial board), TOIS, TKDE, etc. She has published more than 50 papers.

                                    In China, people are familiar with some transactional super apps such as Meituan and Dianping, which are amalgamations of lifestyle services that connect hundreds of millions of customers to local businesses. These apps have reshaped life for hundreds of millions of people throughout China’s cities, expediting the booking and delivery of services such as food, hotel stays, and movie tickets. Artificial intelligence techniques play a critical role behind these apps. In this talk, I will introduce how we build the world’s largest food and entertainment knowledge graph called “Meituan Brain”. Upon this knowledge graph, I will showcase some intelligent scenarios such as a personal assistant and a merchant assistant to help people eat better and live better.

                                    Strava is the world’s largest sports participation platform, adding 1 million new athletes every month, and a leader in its category, solving hard technical and scientific problems (geospatial + mapping) using algorithms and AI. In this presentation, Yandong Liu, Chief Technology Officer of Strava will share how the social network for athletes understands content from the platform’s 15 million weekly uploads, how it understands its athletes across 195 home countries, and how Strava is using machine learning to personalize members’ experiences and connect athletes with content that motivates them and fosters discovery - both now and in the future.

                                    With the rise of global content sharing platforms such as Tiktok, Twitter, and Instagram, content sharing across many languages has been a real need. Machine translation provides essential tools for cross-lingual online content sharing and communication. In this talk, we will highlight a few key problems and challenges: namely resource scarcity, the lack of benchmarks for certain domains, and the call for high performance translation algorithms. We will present an end-to-end speech-to-text translation model. We will present two new tasks along with benchmarks, document-to-document machine translation and video guided machine translation. We will establish metrics to evaluate coherence for long text translation in addition to the traditional BLEU score. We will present novel and scalable methods with linear-time translation and non-autoregressive decoding. Finally, we will present the applications of machine translation for Tiktok and Topbuzz platforms.
