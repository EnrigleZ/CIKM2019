                                    The Fisher-Rao metric is a Riemannian metric defined on any manifold
                                    that
                                    forms
                                    the
                                    parameter space for a family of probability distributions. The metric is
                                    specified
                                    by quadratic forms defined on the tangent spaces of the manifold. If a
                                    parameterisation of the manifold is chosen then each quadratic form is
                                    given
                                    by
                                    a
                                    symmetric positive definite matrix. Lengths, areas, volumes and
                                    hyper-volumes
                                    calculated using the Fisher-Rao metric are invariant under
                                    reparameterisation.
                                    This
                                    invariance is essential in practice because the parameterisation can be
                                    changed
                                    arbitrarily while keeping the data unchanged. The Fisher-Rao metric is
                                    obtained
                                    as a
                                    limit of the expected value of the log likelihood ratio for two nearby
                                    probability
                                    distributions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The inverse of the Fisher-Rao matrix is the Cramer-Rao lower bound on
                                    the
                                    covariance of an unbiased estimate of a parameter. The Fisher-Rao metric
                                    is
                                    used
                                    to divide the parameter space for the Hough transform method for
                                    detecting
                                    structures in data. Each division or accumulator is invariant under
                                    reparametrerisation, and the number of accumulators is proportional to
                                    the
                                    volume of the parameter space. Accurate approximations to the Fisher Rao
                                    metric
                                    are obtained for lines, catadioptric images of lines, circles, ellipses
                                    and
                                    the
                                    cross ratio. It is shown that the Fisher-Rao metric can be used to
                                    compare
                                    the
                                    amount of information in point features with the amount of information
                                    in
                                    edge
                                    element features.

                                    The real-world big data are largely unstructured, interconnected, and
                                    dynamic, in
                                    the form of natural language text. It is highly desirable to transform
                                    such
                                    massive
                                    unstructured data into structured knowledge. Many researchers rely on
                                    labor-intensive labeling and curation to extract knowledge from such
                                    data,
                                    which may
                                    not be scalable, especially considering that a lot of text corpora are
                                    highly
                                    dynamic and domain specific. We believe that massive text data itself
                                    may
                                    disclose a
                                    large body of hidden patterns, structures, and knowledge. With
                                    domain-independent
                                    and domain-dependent knowledge bases, we propose to explore the power of
                                    massive
                                    data itself for turning unstructured data into structured knowledge. By
                                    organizing
                                    massive text documents into multidimensional text cubes, we show
                                    structured
                                    knowledge can be extracted and used effectively.

                                    In this talk, we introduce a set of methods developed recently in our

                                    for such
                                    an exploration, including mining quality phrases, entity recognition and
                                    typing,
                                    multi-faceted taxonomy construction, and construction and exploration of
                                    multi-dimensional text cubes. We show that data-driven approach could be
                                    a
                                    promising

                                    those in
                                    statistics, artificial intelligence/machine learning, data management,

                                    example,
                                    I will demonstrate that the nature of data science practice is to

                                    Visual recognition technology is very important for autonomous driving
                                    especially in
                                    direction of mass production. In this talk, we will introduce the
